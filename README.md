## Assignment
Refactor starting code
## Problems with starting code
The website was lacking accessability.
The search engine optimization link was not working correctly. It was not responding to the CSS.
The HTML was not organized very well.
## Solutions
I added alt attributes to the images to make them more accessable. 
I gave the search engine optimization link a class so it would respond to the CSS. 
I gave the HTML semantic elements making it easier to read the code and more organized.
